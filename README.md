# Odds Analysis
Script for finding guaranteed winning combinations based on data from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/). 
The script is currently set up to look for combinations on games from the Premier League, but with some modifications should
work for all sports supported by the API.

## Usage
First of all, register for an API key from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/). Then create a new file in the project root
called api-key.txt, and paste your key. Finally, run the script to find winning odds combination.
